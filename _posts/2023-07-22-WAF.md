Flag on our website is protected by the state of the art web application firewall!
https://waf.ecsc23.hack.cert.pl/ 

```python
import re
from flask import Flask, Response, send_file

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.after_request
def waf(response: Response) -> Response:
    response.direct_passthrough = False
    if re.match(b'ecsc23{\\w+}', response.data):
        return Response(status=401)
    else:
        return response


@app.route("/flag")
def get_flag() -> Response:
    return send_file("flag.txt")


@app.route("/")
def get_root() -> Response:
    return "<h1>This site is protectedy by WAF</h1>"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0")

```

## First look
As we see the WAF works pretty simple here, just by checking the response content. WAF checks is the returned content contain's a flag by: ```re.match(b'ecsc23{\\w+}', response.data)``` with means basiclly that returned conent cannot be something like this: ```ecsc23{abc_123}```.

Wherever we go on website, firstly ```waf()``` function executes and then (if ```if``` returns false) pass response to us. So we can't bypass WAF (??).

## Second opionion
Later, I checked the site and there was nothing interesting there except the version of the server ```nginx 1.18.0``` (surprising!). This version has many vulnerabilities, regreding to snyk.io 35 critical, 60 High . But after checking few I thinks this is not the point. 

## Gi ve me th e  fl ag
The only way I could think of was to force the server to return my response in a different format so that WAF would not catch the string contained in the regex.
After reading the HTTP headers, I found nothing of interest. But the thought occurred to me that I could force the server to send me a response in parts, that way WAF would never catch the full text and thus the regex condition would not be fulfilled.

And here comes, all on white ```Range``` header. From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range):
![Alt text](/assets/posts/waf/mdn.png)

So let's try it. We just skip first letter ```e``` so the regex ```'ecsc23{\\w+}'``` will not be met:
```sh
$ curl -H "Range: bytes=1-" -i https://waf.ecsc23.hack.cert.pl/flag
